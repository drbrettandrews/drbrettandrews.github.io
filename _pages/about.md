Hi, I’m Dr. Brett Andrews — academic dean, data scientist, and educator with a passion for strategy, AI, and faith integration in higher education. I serve as the Dean of the School of Business at Belhaven University, where I lead innovative programs in business, data science, and computer information systems.

My professional mission is to bridge the gap between data-driven insight and human-centered leadership. Whether I’m helping students understand machine learning or coaching faculty on strategic differentiation in a post-AI world, I bring energy, humor, and clarity to complex topics. I believe in the redemptive potential of work, the ethical use of technology, and the role of education as a public good.

I’m also an author, speaker, and occasional smart-aleck who’s not afraid to challenge conventional thinking — especially if it leads to a better student experience, stronger institutions, or a more informed public.
